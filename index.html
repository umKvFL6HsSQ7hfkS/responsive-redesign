        <div class="background-box">
            <h2>Background</h2>
            <p> Frey & Florist Greenhouses is a Providence-based flower 
                shop selling through both brick-and-mortar and e-commerce channels.
                The <a class="website" href="https://www.providenceriflowershop.com/">website</a>,  however, has a number of usability issues.
            Here are three frames of the homepage annotated with what I find 
            to be the main issues their current <a class="website" href="https://www.providenceriflowershop.com/">website</a>: </p>

            <h4>Overall problems</h4> 
            <a class="issues"> Going through the website's homepage above, we see 4 main issues: </a>
            <ol class="custom-counter">
                <li> No company name in the header which leads to poor memorability and branding issues
                </li> <br>
                <li> Overwhelming navigation bar with odd or overly specific categories and overwhelming sub-categories, 
                    all of which doe not align with flexbility and efficiency of use and thus negatatively impact usability
                </li> <br>
                <li> Unintuitive listing of product offerings (with limited-time and common products hidden on the page)
                    in an unatural and illogical manner that do not match between system and the real world</li><br>

                <li> Cluttered footer with redundant or irrelevant information and links that do not present in an
                    aesthetic and minimalist design
                </li>
            </ol> 
            <h4>Accessibility issues</h4> 
                <p class="accesibility">As detected using WebAIM WAVE, there are over 20 contrast errors on this homepage alone. 
                    I would agree that these contrast areas are very obvious. Personally, I had a bit of a challenging time 
                    reading the options in the navigation bar, and I had to adjust my brightness in order to view 
                    it properly. Additionally, WebAIM WAVE flagged the high volumne of alt tags; when using Inspect
                    Element on the homepage, I noticed that a number of the alt tags have poor descriptions for the images
                    they're describing. For example, the alt tag for the "Custom Arrangements" only says "Custom Flower Design"
                    with no mention that this is a product offering.

        <div class="visual-redesign">
            <h2>Visual Redesign</h2>
            <h4>Lofi Designs</h4> 
            <p class="lofi-explanation"> Before I developed my hifi designs or the actual redesigned website, I started with lofi designs designed using Balsamiq for 
                three types of screen views: desktop, tablet, and mobile. The yellow "sticky" notes indicate how my lofi design
                address the issues I found in Frey's original website design. </br> <br>
                <a> Note: </a> &nbsp; </br> The black dots between the frames for each device 
                represent the scrolling aspect; I chose to cut out some of the original wireframe since the images would be too long and would
                not provide any additional insight as they would show repeated elements. </p>
            
            <h3> Desktop </h3>
            <img class="lofi-original" src="lofi/desktop-lofi.png" alt="Top half of desktop lofi annotated with sticky notes">
            <img class="black-circle" src="circle.png" alt="Black circle">

            <img class="lofi-original" src="lofi/desktop-lofi-cont.png" alt="Bottom half of desktop lofi annotated with sticky notes">
            
            <h3> Tablet </h3>
            <img class="lofi-original" src="lofi/tablet-lofi.png" alt="Top half of tablet lofi annotated with sticky notes">
            <img class="black-circle" src="circle.png" alt="Black circle">

            <img class="black-circle" src="circle.png" alt="Black circle">
            <img class="lofi-original" src="lofi/tablet-lofi-cont.png" alt="Bottom half of tablet lofi annotated with sticky notes">

            <p> In summary, these lofi wireframes address the three main issues I had listed previously surrounding
                usability and memorability of the website. </p>
            
            <h4>Visual Design Style Guide</h4> 
            <p> Before starting my hifi designs and development, I created a visual design style guide in Figma
                that displayed the main colors, typography, and reusable components used throughout my hifi designs. 
            </p>
            <img class="lofi-original" src="vsg.png" alt="Top half of tablet lofi annotated with sticky notes">
            
            <h4>Hifi Designs</h4> 

            <a class="note"> Note:</a> The black dots between the frames for each device represent the scrolling aspect; I 
            did this for the hifi wireframes as well to cut to save space as the elements not shown are redundant (and reflected in the 
            screenshots I did include). </p>

                I did ulimately have some issues trying to implement the hamburger menu for the smaller screen sizes; this is something I plan to explore further
                when I revise this webpage later on in the semester and have more web dev experience.
